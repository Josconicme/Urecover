/*
  # Remove demo credentials dependency

  This migration removes the need for demo credentials by updating the login screen
  to not reference non-existent demo users.
  
  Since we cannot create auth.users through SQL migrations (managed by Supabase Auth),
  we'll handle this by removing the demo credentials section from the UI.
  
  No database changes needed - this is a placeholder migration.

-- This migration intentionally contains no SQL operations
-- The demo credentials issue is resolved by updating the frontend code
